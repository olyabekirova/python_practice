# .value_counts() to determine the top 15 countries ranked by total number of medals
# result is returned as a Series of counts indexed by unique entries from the original Series with values (counts)
# ranked in descending order

# or use .pivot_table() to count by types

# .drop_duplicates()
# .nunique() returns the number of distinct categories

# Group medals by 'NOC': country_grouped
country_grouped = medals.groupby('NOC')

# Compute the number of distinct sports in which each country won medals: Nsports
Nsports = country_grouped['Sport'].nunique()

# Sort the values of Nsports in descending order
Nsports = Nsports.sort_values(ascending = False)

# Print the top 15 rows of Nsports
print(Nsports.head(15))
